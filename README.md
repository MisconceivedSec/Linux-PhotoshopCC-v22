# Photoshop-CC2021-Linux

**DISCLAIMER :**

I forked this repo and adjusted the script to keep the files that are downloaded, so that they don't have to be downloaded every time you want to reinstall.

Also, installing `vdk3d proton` gave me some problems with my GPU, so I made it optional.

## Requirements
- wine >=6.1 (Avoid 6.20 to 6.22)
- appmenu-gtk-module
- tar
- wget
- All R/W rights on your home folder and the installer folder
- Vulkan capable GPU or APU (optional)
